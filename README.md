my iPhone app <BR>
1. Learn the bit mask stuff from physic body <BR>
2. Highscoreâ€¦ change the way it refreshes the score


3. Create instruction
4. Create a cloud ( the cloud cannot be at the position of the player ), and it is initially white color... as the times goes by... it will turn to greyish color.. and eventually start to shake. If player gets closer to it, it will hurt the player.
